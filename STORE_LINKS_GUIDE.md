# GitaWisdom Store Links & Share Functionality Guide

## 🔗 How Store Links Work

### Current Status
Your app currently uses **smart fallback URLs** that work in both development and production:

- **Development/Testing**: Shows search results for "GitaWisdom" 
- **Production**: Will show your actual app page once published

### Store URLs Structure

#### Google Play Store
```
Current: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hub4apps.gitawisdom
```

#### Apple App Store  
```
Template: https://apps.apple.com/app/gitawisdom/id[YOUR_APP_ID]
You'll get the App ID after publishing to App Store
```

## 📱 How It Works Now

### 1. Development Phase (Current)
- **Android**: Shows Play Store search for "GitaWisdom"
- **iOS**: Shows App Store search for "GitaWisdom"  
- **Message**: "Coming Soon!" with search instructions

### 2. After Publishing
- **Android**: Direct link to your app page
- **iOS**: Direct link to your app page (after App Store approval)
- **Message**: "Download now" with direct store links

## 🚀 Publishing Process & Link Updates

### Step 1: Google Play Store Publishing
1. **Upload your AAB** to Google Play Console
2. **Complete store listing** (description, screenshots, etc.)
3. **Publish the app**
4. **Get your actual Play Store URL**:
   ```
   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hub4apps.gitawisdom
   ```

### Step 2: Apple App Store Publishing  
1. **Archive your iOS app** in Xcode
2. **Upload to App Store Connect**
3. **Complete app information**
4. **Submit for review**
5. **After approval, get your App Store URL**:
   ```
   https://apps.apple.com/app/gitawisdom/id[ACTUAL_APP_ID]
   ```

### Step 3: Update App Links (Important!)
After both stores approve your app, update the URLs in:

**File**: `lib/services/app_sharing_service.dart`

```dart
// UPDATE THESE AFTER PUBLISHING! 🚨
static const String _playStoreUrl = 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hub4apps.gitawisdom';
static const String _appStoreUrl = 'https://apps.apple.com/app/gitawisdom/id[YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID]';
```
