# iOS Testing Guide for GitaWisdom

## ✅ iOS Configuration Status
Your iOS project is fully configured and ready for testing! All iOS code is intact and properly set up for multilingual support.

## 🔧 iOS Configuration Updates Made
1. **Added multilingual support** to `ios/Runner/Info.plist` with 15 language localizations
2. **Updated Podfile** to ensure iOS 13.0+ compatibility
3. **Verified all iOS builds** work correctly (device and simulator)

## 📱 iOS Testing Options

### Option 1: iOS Simulator Testing
```bash
# Run in iOS Simulator (recommended for initial testing)
flutter run -d "iPhone 15 Pro"

# Or list available simulators first
flutter devices
# Then run with specific simulator ID
flutter run -d <simulator-id>
```

### Option 2: Physical iOS Device Testing
```bash
# Connect iPhone/iPad via USB, ensure it's unlocked and trusted
# Then run (requires Apple Developer account for code signing)
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

### Option 3: Build for iOS Device (requires code signing)
```bash
# Build for device (requires Apple Developer account)
flutter build ios

# Build for simulator
flutter build ios --simulator
```

   flutter run -d iPhone
   ```

3. **Test language switching**:
   - Open app → More → App Language
   - Switch between languages
   - Verify content updates immediately
   - Check translation coverage percentages
